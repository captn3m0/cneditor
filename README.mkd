#CNeditor

CNeditor is a web-based simple file browser/editor written in PHP. Please do not upload it on your host, unless you understand the implications that come along with it.

I have used it on numerous occasions, as a quick hack to update files, pen-test websites, and simply play. I wrote it back in Mar-2010.
